## How to commit
All commits should follow this format:
`{place}:{what}.`
Example:
`project/test.js: Added unit tests.`

## Coding rules

About the naming: We are following camelCase. It means that for variables, instances we name as follow:
`testApp`
`myCounter`
And about class:
`MyCharacter`
`NetworkController`

Do not forget to place spaces before and after symbols.
Not `a=1;`
But `a = 1;`

Be careful about trailing whitespaces...
